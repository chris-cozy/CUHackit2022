<h2>Description</h2>
This is a text-based fantasy horror adventure game demo. This was my first experience learning and using javascript, and the purpose of the project was to put into practice the concepts I had been learning.
I made this project to be an entry to CUHackit2022, a Clemson-based Hackathon. This was also my first experience in creating a text-based game. I enjoyed playing *A Dark Room* which led mt want to create my own text-based game.

<h2>Developer Notes</h2>
More complexity and intents may be added in the future.

<h3>Desired Additions</h3>

- A smooth inventory and player stats system. Could have an object containing all of the player's items, and an object containing player's current statistics (Health, Level, EXP, Skills)
- An NPC stats system. Could have an object to represent an NPC. This object could contain their name and health, as well as possible actions (I.E pet, hug)
- An NPC interaction system
